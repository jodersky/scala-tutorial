A very basic message-board-like website, intended to be used as a practical
Scala tutorial.

## Structure

Each commit in the master branch represents a step in the tutorial.

It starts out with an empty project, with only a build-tool wrapper included. A
web server is then created an progressively enhanced with a static UI, a
database, an interactive UI, and even a command line tool.

All features are implemented with various Scala libraries and tools, including
ScalaJS and Scala Native

It is recommended to use this repository as a guidline, but follow the tutorial
in a separate folder. You can always look at the latest commit in master to see
the final version.
